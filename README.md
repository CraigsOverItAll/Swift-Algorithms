Swift-Algorithms
================

Implementation of various algorithms and data structures in Swift.

Feel free to add more implementations!

Each implementation is done in Xcode playground. To view code, either:

1. Clone the repo and import in Xcode, *or*

2. View the .swift file in each .playground folder (on Github)
